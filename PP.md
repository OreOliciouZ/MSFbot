# Privacy Policy for Missing Star Fleet

**Last Updated:** June 20, 2025

This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, why we collect it, and how you can manage it when you use **Missing Star Fleet** ("the Bot").

## 1. What Data We Collect and Why

To provide its services, the Bot stores the following data:

-   **User ID:** Your unique Discord ID is stored as the primary identifier for your economy data and moderation logs. This is necessary for the bot to remember your balance, items, and warnings.
-   **Guild (Server) ID:** We store the server ID where a warning is issued to ensure warnings are specific to that server.
-   **Moderator ID:** When a warning is issued, we store the User ID of the moderator who issued it for accountability.
-   **Economy Data:** We store your wallet/bank balances, item inventories, and command cooldowns to make the economy game function correctly.

## 2. Data Storage & Security

The Bot and its database are hosted on **Discloud**. We take reasonable measures to secure your data from unauthorized access, but please be aware that no method of electronic storage is 100% secure.

## 3. Third-Party Services

Besides Discloud for hosting, the Bot does not share data with any other third-party services.

## 4. Your Rights and Data Deletion

You have the right to request the complete deletion of your user-specific data (your economy profile and warning history). To do so, please join our official **[Support Server](https://discord.gg/asRaJG9zCc)** and contact a staff member.

## 5. Contact Us

If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us in our **[Support Server](https://discord.gg/asRaJG9zCc)**.
